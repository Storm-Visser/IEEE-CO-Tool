<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to the CIS Conference Organisers Tool 2025 </h2>

Many of our IEEE CIS Volunteers have vast conference organization experience but may need fast access to the latest rules and updated information, as well as having access to useful hints and guidelines for particular conference organisation activities. Further, support is needed for the important role that our conference organisers play in  training up our next generation of conference organisers.

The default 2025 tool provides: 

1. An accessible and searchable information source, with all activities listed under suitable themes, including hints and guidelines, IEEE CIS rules and links to further information. 
2. Relative dates. All activities include default relative dates wrt key conference dates(provided by the GC(s) at ADCOM approval).   
3. Vertical lists of activities( by theme), colour coded for ease of reference
4. Cards (activities) within lists in cronological order, upcoming activities showing at the top of each list
5. Each card labelled with the default key role (chair) responsible/leader for the activity  
6. IEEE CIS online support for technical questions or conference organising questions

<h2 id='OC'>Organising Committee roles</h2>

The default cards use 'labels' for the default roles (chairs) in  an Organising Committee. Such default roles include the General chair, Program chair, Local chair, Proceedings chair, Industry chair, Finance chair, Poster Session chair, COI chair, Publicity chair, Keynote chair, Tutorial chair Diversity and Inclusion Chair

If the default Organising Committee does not match yours then you can change the labelling easily:
Go to the menu '...', topright
click on 'labels'

*  If you wish to merge tasks e.g the program chair is also the poster chair;
click on a suitable card (with poster label), click on label-> deselect current label -> click on alternative label (program). 

*  If you wish to add a new label/new role(chair) in your organising committee
click on a suitable card, add label (+) beside the current label-> deselect current label -> click on create new label-> add name/role and colour. This new label can be added to any card, as highlighted in 1 above.

<h2 id='members'>Adding members to a board</h2>

It is encouraged to signup all Organising Committee members to your board, even if you choose not to use the Co-tool active in managing your organising committee.
