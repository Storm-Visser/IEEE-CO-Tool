Server starts DB, Logger, and API
These things allow for a local backup of data, which is why everything worked untill it was wiped
would be nice too see things in the log files, but they were probably cleared as well

Client side is where the problem is
Index.html starts everything up
Connector.js connects all of the parts, including a button to authorize the powerup.
Authorize.html is where the client side wants access to trello, to read and write on the board.
This is where the problem likely is

All other files have nothing to do with authorization, but will still need refractor/removal for deprecated stuff (maybe a deprecated folder?) 
CardTimeline
    This contains stuff for the cards on timeline, might need to be removed in favor of trellos own timeline
Boardfunction
    Keeps track of a local (our database) relative timeline synced with card due database
    It gets the saved version of the board, and updates out of sync cards and their children on both boards (trello and saved in DB)
Badgefunction
    For individual cards    
    Shows a badge with a relative date to something (UI)
    If one card changes, syncs everything with backend and all children
    Makes me wonder is the whole board update is required if all children are properly updated each time...
DateFunction
    Subscribe to a .ics calender thing if they want
Markdown
    Renders .md in .html, might not work properly, and might be unnececary
Popup
    Lets user set relative due date by selecting a parent and time difference
    Can also remove parent
    Triggers an update for everything
Timeline 
    Stuff for the actual calender view, also deprecated?
TimelineSidebar
    sidebar for the timeline, also deprecated?
Utils
    Only updates cards in the rules list (first one)
    Gets the current checklist 
    Find the list(s) that match the current card
    Delete things that are not in the cards in the list(s)
    If a card in the list(s) contains a "IEEE CIS Requirements", it sysncs those requirements to the original card
    Also creates a new one if nececary
