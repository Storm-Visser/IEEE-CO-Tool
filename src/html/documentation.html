				Many of our IEEE CIS General Chairs have vast conference organization experience but may 
				need fast access to the latest rules and updated information provided 
				in this tool. Further, many of our General Chairs support bringing 
				on our next generation of conference organisers (CO)s and this tool 
				provides much of the hints and guidelines that our IEEE CIS COs have 
				contributed to over the years. The tool also provides filtering of the
				information for specific roles. 
			</p>
			<p>The default tool provides</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>
					An accessible and searchable information source, with all activities listed under suitable themes,
					 including hints and guidelines, IEEE CIS rules and links to further information. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Relative dates. All activities include relative dates wrt key conference dates. 
					The tool provides automatic conversion of such deadlines to actual calendar dates 
					when the key conference dates are entered. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Simplified information view due to the possibility to filter information shown (currently through Trello's own filtering system)
				</li>
				<li>
			<!--		A detailed timeline view for all activities together with the possibility to filter information shown i.e. show
					 only activity for a specific role(currently unavailable but filtering provides a similar view)
				</li>
				<li>
					Option to include the entire timeline or role specific timeline in the users daily calendar. Each activity linking directly
					back to the activity card in Trello. (currently unavailable

    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="addmembers">Adding members to board</h2>
				<p>
					Adding a new team member to a board is done by clicking the invite button in the 
					board's toolbar or from the menu '...'. A member will be able to edit, comment and invite 
					other people to the board. This allows your chairs to edit their activities, refine deadlines, add activities osv.

    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="roles">Assigning Team Members to cards</h2>
				<p>
					Where more than one chair is involved in a particular role,they can assign a card to a specific peron, giving that 
					team member a notification, if any updates are made to a card. 
				</p>

			<h2 style="padding-top: 20px;
    width: 100%;
    border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;
    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="labels">Labels</h2>
			<p>
				Each card has a label - indicating the Chair whose role covers leading  this activity. The may wish to assign a 
				particular activity to a member with the same role or a different role but as the label bearer they are still 
				responsible for following up this task.

    border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;
    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="filtering">Filtering cards</h2>
			<p>
				The simplest way to filter cards is to use Trello's filtering (3 lines on the top bar).
				If filtering for a role then select label (the role), select collapse empty lists. 
				All the tasks for that particular roles will be shown

    padding-bottom: .3rem;" id="power-up">Relative Due Date Power-Up</h2>
			<p>
				
			We are currently experiencing new authorisation challenges with the powerup so further features currently not available 
			are removed from this description. 
			<!-- The relative due date power-up was created to allow a card's due date to be
				dependent on another. If the parent card's due date changes, the original 
				card's will also change. That way a General Chair only needs to set the due 
				date of the conference's start date and all tentative dates will be set on 
				the cards that are depending on that card. Almost all the cards in the IEEE 
				CIS Conference Template will have a relative due date, but it is also possible 
				to change som dependencies if that works better for conference planning. 
			</p>
			<h3>Adding a parent to card</h3>
			<p>
				Adding, changing or removing a parent card is easy. By clicking on the
				<code>Relative Due Date</code> button inside the card (see image below).
			</p>
			<img src="../assets/relbutton.png" width="300"/>
			<p>
				This will open a popup in which you can search for the parent card. 
				You can also remove a parent if applicable. 
			</p>
			<img src='../assets/popup.png' width='300'/>
			<p>
				By clicking one of the card names that appear, you will be prompted to define 
				the difference between the parent card and the original card. The difference is 
				how many months before or after the due date of the parent card, the original 
				card's due date will be. If the parent card has a due date, the due date of the 
				original card will change according to the difference set. If the original card 
				has cards that are dependant on it, their due dates will also change.
			</p>
			<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
			<p>
				The IEEE CIS Conference Template can be a little overwhelming, and getting a general
				timeline of when things happen can be hard by looking a the Kanban board.
					Therefore, we created a timeline visualization of the cards on your board. 
					The timeline can be opened by clicking the timeline button on the boards 
					toolbar (see picture) or by clicking the timeline button inside a card. 
			</p>
			<img src='../assets/timelinebtn.png' width='500'>
			<p>
				The timeline can be grouped by week, month or quarterly depending on how compact 
				you want the timeline too look. You can also define the different labels that 
				are shown in the timeline by clicking the cehckboxes in the sidebar. 
			</p>
			<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>
			<p>
				When the date for the conference has been set, a calendar file for the event can be 
				downloaded for the conference. Inside the timeline, you will get the option to 
				download an `ics` file that can be imported to your personal calendar containing 
				the different cards on the board. If you only want the cards that are relevant for 
				a specific label, you can check the boxes and then download the calendar.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want a calendar that is always up to date with the latest changes to the board, 
				you can subscribe to the calendar by copying the url below the download button in 
				the sidebar.
